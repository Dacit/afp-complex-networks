@article{ProofMining2020Nawaz,
    abstract = {Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are software tools that allow human users to write and verify formal proofs. In recent years, an emerging research area in ITPs is proof mining, which consists of identifying interesting proof patterns that can be used to guide the interactive proof process in ITPs. In previous studies, some data mining techniques, such as frequent pattern mining, have been used to analyze proofs to find frequent proof steps. Though useful, such models ignore the facts that not all proof steps are equally important. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel proof mining approach based on finding not only frequent patterns but also high utility patterns to find proof steps of high importance (utility). A proof process learning approach is proposed based on high utility itemset mining (HUIM) for the PVS (Prototype Verification System) proof assistant. Proofs in PVS theories are first abstracted to a computer-processable corpus, where each line represents a proof sequence and proof commands in proof sequences are associated with utilities representing their weightage (importance). HUIM techniques are then applied on the corpus to discover frequent proof steps/high utility patterns and their relationships with each other. Experimental results suggest that combining frequent pattern mining techniques, such as sequential pattern mining and high utility itemset mining, with proof assistants, such as PVS, is useful to learn and guide the proof development process.},

We further identify several applications in software engineering, and propose different network-based quality indicators that address software design, efficiency, reusability, vulnerability, controllability and other.

In order to allocate resources effectively, managers need to rely on their experience backed by code complexity metrics. But often dependencies exist between various pieces of code over which managers may have little knowledge. These dependencies can be construed as a low level graph of the entire system. In this paper, we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003, we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10% points higher than for models built from complexity metrics. In addition, network measures could identify 60% of the binaries that the Windows developers considered as critical-twice as many as identified by complexity metrics.},

In this letter we present the first evidence for the emergence of scaling (and the presence of small-world behavior) in software architecture graphs from a well-defined local optimization process. Although the rules that define the strategies involved in software engineering should lead to a tree-like structure, the final net is scale-free, perhaps reflecting the presence of conflicting constraints unavoidable in a multidimensional optimization process. The consequences for other complex networks are outlined.},
